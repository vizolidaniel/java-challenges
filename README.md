# Java Challenges

A personal collection of coding challenges implemented in Java, created for study, practice, and enhancing problem-solving skills.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders, each containing Java coding challenges:

### arrays/
- **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
- **Maximum Subarray**: Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
- **Contains Duplicate**: Given an integer array, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array.
- **Product of Array Except Self**: Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
- **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

### dynamic_programming/
- **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
- **Coin Change**: Given coins of different denominations and a total amount, return the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If not possible, return -1.
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Given an integer array, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
- **House Robber**: You are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has money, but adjacent houses cannot be robbed. Find the maximum amount you can rob.
- **Edit Distance**: Given two strings, return the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) required to convert one string into the other.

### graphs/
- **Number of Islands**: Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
- **Clone Graph**: Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
- **Course Schedule**: Given the total number of courses and prerequisites, determine if you can finish all courses.
- **Graph Valid Tree**: Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of edges, check if the edges form a valid tree.
- **Word Ladder**: Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.

### sorting_searching/
- **Binary Search**: Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return -1.
- **Search Insert Position**: Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if found. If not, return the index where it would be inserted in order.
- **Merge Sort**: Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- **Quick Sort**: Implement the quick sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- **Find First and Last Position**: Given a sorted array of integers and a target, return the starting and ending position of the target value.

### strings/
- **Reverse String**: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters.
- **Valid Palindrome**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Implement strStr()**: Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring (needle) in a string (haystack). If not found, return -1.
- **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.

### misc/
- **FizzBuzz**: Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print "Fizz", for multiples of five print "Buzz", and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz".
- **LRU Cache**: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
- **Min Stack**: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- **Roman to Integer**: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
- **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

## 💻 How to Run

To get started with any challenge:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the Java file.
2. Compile the file using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled file using:
   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

For example, to run `TwoSum.java` in the `arrays` folder:
```bash
cd arrays/
javac TwoSum.java
java TwoSum
```

## 🎯 Goals

The goals of this repository are:
